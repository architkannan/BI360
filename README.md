### ‚ùóThe Problem
- **AtliQ Hardwares**, a fast-growing electronics company (like HP or Dell), sells PCs, keyboards, and printers through both **brick-and-mortar** and **e-commerce** platforms.
- Rapid expansion led to challenges in **data transparency, stakeholder alignment, and profitability tracking**, particularly in the **Latin American market**.
- Competitor **Dell** leveraged advanced analytics for faster, smarter decisions ‚Äî exposing AtliQ‚Äôs heavy reliance on Excel-based, siloed reporting.

To stay competitive and enable faster strategic decision-making, AtliQ decided to **centralize its reporting ecosystem using Power BI**.
