## ❗ The Problem

**AtliQ Hardwares**, a fast-growing PC and electronics manufacturer, sells across **brick-and-mortar** and **e-commerce** channels in 27 global markets.

As revenues scaled, the company struggled with:

- Fragmented reporting across **sales, finance, supply chain, and marketing**  
- Heavy dependence on **Excel-based** static reports  
- Limited visibility into **Latin American market performance**  
- Slow decision-making compared with analytics-driven competitors like **Dell**

To become more data-driven and support faster strategy decisions, AtliQ needed a **centralized, interactive Power BI reporting system** that all business functions could rely on.
